Observable W3C Web Components
===========================
# NOTICE

This repo is now deprecated. Due to the obsolescence of Object.observe, elliptical.component as a standalone observable web component library for declarative two-way data-binding
has ceased development. Certain core modules ,however, will live on as behaviors for the polymer library.
